Fibonacci Sequence Generator

Description:
This Python program generates the Fibonacci sequence using recursion based on the user input for the desired length of the sequence. The program includes error handling for invalid inputs and limits the sequence length to be between 1 and 50.

Instructions:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If Python is not installed, you can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Save the provided Python code in a file named 'fibonacci_generator.py'.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where 'fibonacci_generator.py' is saved.
4. Run the program by executing the command: python fibonacci_generator.py
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the desired length of the Fibonacci sequence.
6. The program will generate and display the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified length.

Additional Notes:
- The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
- The program uses a recursive approach to generate the Fibonacci sequence efficiently.
- Error handling is implemented to validate user input and ensure it falls within a reasonable range.
- The FibonacciGenerator class contains methods for generating and printing the sequence in a formatted manner.
- The program output includes the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified length.
